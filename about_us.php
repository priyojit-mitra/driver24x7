			Driver 24x7 is a platform where any car owner can get a driver very conveniently. The only thing he or she has
			to do is enter his or her location and contact number on the Home page and click on the "CHECK AVALABILITY" button.
			Now the drivers will also get regular trips with the help of this website. They just need to register themselves 
			by filling up the registration form given on the Home page and then click on the "REGISTER NOW" button. 
			Just remember one thing, the location must be entered correctly otherwise the customers will get incorrect output.
			So, it's very easy to use and much less data consuming as well. The car owners will get the complete details of the
			driver who is available at that location.
